# Prims-Algorithm
The PrimsAlgorithm class in this Java program implements Prim's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected weighted graph.
The program prompts the user to enter the number of vertices and edges, followed by the details of each edge (vertex1, vertex2, weight), and then displays the MST.
The algorithm uses a greedy approach by selecting the edge with the minimum weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST until all vertices are included in the MST
